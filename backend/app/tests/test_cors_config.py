"""Tests for CORS origin resolution (finding S7 remediation).

The interesting assertions here are the negative ones. The bug being prevented
is not "CORS is configured" but "wildcard origins and credentials are
configured *together*", which is a pairing that silently trusts every website.
So several tests below assert that a combination cannot be produced at all,
rather than that a particular value was returned.

"""Tests for the SECRET_KEY strength check (finding S15).

`app/core/config.py` already refused to start with a *missing* SECRET_KEY (a
Day-3 fix). This pins the other half: a *weak* one is refused in production and
warned about loudly elsewhere, which is the failure mode that survives a
deployment checklist, because everything appears to work.

Why 32 bytes: HS256 uses the secret directly as an HMAC key, and RFC 7518
section 3.2 requires the key to be at least as long as the hash output. PyJWT
emits an `InsecureKeyLengthWarning` below that; a warning in a container log is
not a control, so in production the check is a startup failure instead.

Why not a failure everywhere: a rule that fails unconditionally could take a
running service down over a development key, which trades a real control for an
outage. The asymmetry matches `app/core/cors.py`, which is strict about wildcard
origins in production only. (The sibling CertiFake enforces this
unconditionally, because nothing there is deployed -- a documented difference,
not an inconsistency by accident.)

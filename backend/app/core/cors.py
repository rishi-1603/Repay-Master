"""CORS origin resolution.

Added in the Day-7 security remediation (finding S7 in the audit's security
register). The problem being fixed is specific and worth stating precisely,
because the naive description of it overstates today's risk:

Before this module, `main.py` did::

    origins = ["*"] if settings.CORS_ORIGINS == "*" else settings.CORS_ORIGINS.split(",")
    app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=origins, allow_credentials=True, ...)

and `CORS_ORIGINS` defaulted to `"*"`. Wildcard origins combined with
`allow_credentials=True` is the pairing that matters: in that combination
Starlette does NOT send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (browsers forbid that
with credentials). It echoes the request's `Origin` back and adds
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, which means *any* website is trusted
to make credentialed cross-origin requests and read the responses.

How much of that was actually exploitable here: not much, today. This API
authenticates with `Authorization: Bearer` tokens and never calls
`set_cookie`, so a malicious page has no ambient credential to ride -- it
cannot make the browser attach a token it cannot read. The finding is therefore
MEDIUM and not HIGH: a latent misconfiguration that becomes a real
cross-origin data-theft bug the moment anyone adds a cookie or a session. That
is exactly the kind of thing worth fixing before it is load-bearing rather
than after.

Two rules follow, and both are enforced here rather than left to an operator
remembering them:

1. A wildcard origin is refused outright when `APP_ENV` is production. Startup
   fails loudly, which is the pattern this codebase already uses for
   `SECRET_KEY` (see `core/config.py`) -- a missing or wrong value should stop
   the process, not quietly weaken it.
2. `allow_credentials` is derived, never hardcoded: it is `True` only when the
   operator listed explicit origins. There is no configuration in which a
   wildcard and credentials coexist, in any environment.
